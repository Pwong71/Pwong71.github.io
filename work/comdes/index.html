          While many schools are becoming more diverse and inclusive, many
          report not yet having the knowledge in creating a safer environment
          for LGBTQ2+ youth. Somewhere Over the Rainbow, promotes a highschool
          seminar regarding how to support LGBTQ2+ youth at school. The campaign
          includes a promotion poster and a foldable collage zine to give out to
          students after the seminar.

          The rainbow flag is known for representing the LGBTQ2 community. The
          colors symbolize the diversity of the community itself and each color
          represents a different meaning. My goal is to combine the flag with
          the infamous song “somewhere over the rainbow” to spread hope,
          positivity and knowledge on this topic. The message of this campaign
          is to take the idea of ‘somewhere’ over the rainbow and make it into a
          vision for this campaign. That ‘somewhere’ will symbolize a safe and
          loving place for all LGBTQ2+ youth at school if the younger generation
          can start spreading love and taking action on this issue.

          I’ll be creating digital collages to present this idea. Inspirations
          for this campaign are drawn from nostalgic illustration books and
          collective childhood memories. Since I’m twisting an old song into a
          new concept, making collages digitally will achieve a futuristic retro
          look.

          The campaign currently only includes a poster and 8 collages with a
          word that represents a color of the rainbow flag. I would like to
          expand on this project by including information about ways to support
          the LGBTQ2+ community behind each collage to provide readers a deeper
          understanding on the social issue. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If expanded, the zine would be designed with four spreads on both
          sides, each spread would consist of a collage and a page of text next
          to it. With this design, the reader can bring home information about
          the topic.
