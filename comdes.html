            <h3>1A. Project Brief</h3>
            <h1>A digital collage zine that represents colors of the LGBTQ2+ rainbow flag.</h1>
            <h3>1B. Intro</h3>    
            <p>While many schools are becoming more diverse and inclusive, many report not yet having the knowledge in creating a safer environment for LGBTQ2+ youth. Somewhere Over the Rainbow, promotes a highschool seminar regarding how to support LGBTQ2+ youth at school.<br><br>The campaign includes a promotion poster and a foldable collage zine to give out to students after the seminar. The zine consists of 8 pages, one collage per page and one composition for each color. It allows students to understand the meaning behind each color of the rainbow flag, which would be a nice piece to bring home.</p>

            <h3>2A. Challenge</h3>
            <h1>To create a new social communication campaign of my own design.</h1>
            <ul>
                <li style="background-color: deeppink">Sex</li>
                <li style="background-color: red">Life</li>
                <li style="background-color: orangered">Healing</li>
                <li style="background-color: yellow">Sunlight</li>
                <li style="background-color: darkgreen">Nature</li>
                <li style="background-color: mediumturquoise">Magic</li>
                <li style="background-color: darkblue">Serenity</li>
                <li style="background-color: rebeccapurple">Spirit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2B. To create the collages, I need to develop a better understanding of the meaning behind each color of the rainbow flag.</p>
            <h3>2C. Target audience</h3> 
            <h1>Young teenagers <br> (age 13-15)</h1>
            <h3>2D. Project Focus</h3>
            <p>The rainbow flag is known for representing the LGBTQ2 community. The colors symbolize the diversity of the community itself and each color represents a different meaning. My goal is to combine the flag with the infamous song “somewhere over the rainbow” to spread hope, positivity and knowledge on this topic. The message of this campaign is to take the idea of ‘somewhere’ over the rainbow and make it into a vision for this campaign. That ‘somewhere’ will symbolize a safe and loving place for all LGBTQ2+ youth at school if the younger generation can start spreading love and taking action on this issue.</p>
            <h3> 2E. Current perception</h3>
            <p>There is definitely a lack of education on the topic of LGBTQ2+ at schools. Teenagers at a young age tend to listen to their peers, their thought processes are often heavily influenced by the information they consume and receive on a daily basis. Being manipulated by stereotypes and other people’s opinions can alter their perception on a lot of important topics. Young teenagers has a tendency to see the LGBTQ2+ community as one whole group of people without knowing what each letter represents and what struggles these individuals are going through.</p>
            <h3>2F. Desired perception</h3> 
            <p>My goal for this campaign is to not only educate teenagers on what this community is all about but also focus on having them embrace the positivity, beauty and energy of this group of individuals, understand and find out what are the daily struggles LGBTQ2 youths are going through and learn how to bring more awareness and attention to this topic.</p>

            <h3>5. Reflection</h3>
            <p>The campaign currently only includes a poster and 8 collages with a word that represents a color of the rainbow flag. I would like to expand on this project by including information about ways to support the LGBTQ2+ community behind each collage to provide readers a deeper understanding on the social issue. If expanded, the zine would be designed with four spreads on both sides, each spread would consist of a collage and a page of text next to it. With this design, the reader can bring home information about the topic.</p>
